# Rename
A file-action-triggered workflow for regex file renaming. It is based upon Tobias Mende's [Bulk Renaming] (http://www.packal.org/workflow/bulk-file-renaming) workflow and then I made a few changes to suit my needs.

The Run Script actions invoke Python scripts that do the heavy lifting.

There are several stages that provide flexibility to the process:

1. Enter the match pattern
2. Enter the replace pattern
3. Confirm the changes

The Replace Pattern menu (#2) is shown below illustrating the options for common replacements.
